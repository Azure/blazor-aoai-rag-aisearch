# Project

This project's purpose is to demonstrate the usage of Semantic Kernel with Dotnet 9. It will orchestrate the use of Azure OpenAI API together with Azure AI Search to provide RAG pattern using custom documents of various types as indexed data. The frontend will be a Blazor  application that will allow the user to interact with the AI. It will be hosted locally on developer machine using Aspire.

Let's [get started](../docs/GettingStarted.md)!
